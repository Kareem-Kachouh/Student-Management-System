# Student-Management-System
Data Structures based project delving into the structures of linkedlists, Binary Search tree, Arrays. Binary Search tree was used because it extends the capabilites of normal arrays, and it is much faster at searching for students record since it has a time complexity of O (log n) than arrays and linked lists which have a time complexity if O(n)
